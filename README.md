# VSSpotifyControls
Visual Studio extension to control Spotify

Inspired by the [Spotify extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/shyykoserhiy.vscode-spotify). Right now with this extension you can only do one thing: Skip to the next song.

Using the [SpotifyAPI-NET](https://github.com/JohnnyCrazy/SpotifyAPI-NET) to connect to Spotify.
